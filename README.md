# DeepWMC
Deep Weighted Monte Carlo

In this repository we publish the code related to our work "Deep Weighted Monte Carlo: A hybrid option pricing framework using neural networks". Since the used historical swaption data is confidential, the model efficiency is demonstrated on dummy data in the "DeepWMC_tutorial.ipynb" jupyter notebook file.
